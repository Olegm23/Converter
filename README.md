The Temperature Converter project was built in React.
I spent two hours on the development.
I managed to finish almost all tasks which I needed to complete.
I ran out of time before I managed to implement the conversions counter feature,
but I understand how it should work and it should not be so difficult.

I used CSS instead of Sass, because the project is very small and there was no need for more complex rules.

Steps for running the application


## Getting started

```
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run local development server
yarn start
```
